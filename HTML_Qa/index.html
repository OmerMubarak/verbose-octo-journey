            <h3> Origins</h3>
            <p > The llama (/ˈlɑːmə/; Spanish pronunciation: [ˈʎama]) (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American
                camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.</p>
            <h3> Medical uses</h3>
            <p> Doctors and researches have determined that llamas possess antibodies that are well suited to treat certain diseases.[37] Scientists have been studying the way llamas might contribute to the fight against coronaviruses, including MERS and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19).</p>

            </h3>
            <p>
                Options for feeding llamas are quite wide; a wide variety of commercial and farm-based feeds are
                available.

            <h3>
                Mating
            </h3>
            <p>
                Llamas mate with in a kush (lying down) position, which is fairly unusual in a large animal. They mate for an extended time (20–45 minutes), also unusual in a large animal.
            </p>
            <h3> Fiber</h3>
            <p>Llamas have a fine undercoat, which can be used for handicrafts and garments. The coarser outer guard hair is used for rugs, wall-hangings and lead ropes. The fiber comes in many different colors ranging from white or grey to reddish-brown, brown, dark brown and black.</p>

            <h3> Characteristics</h3>
            <p> A full-grown llama can reach a height of 1.7 to 1.8 m (5 ft 7 in to 5 ft 11 in) at the top of the head,
                and can weigh between 130 and 200 kg (290 and 440 lb). </p>
            <p>At birth, a baby llama (called a cria) can weigh between 9 and 14 kg (20 and 31 lb).</p>

                <h3>Resemblance to other animals</h3>
                <p> The skull generally resembles that of Camelus, the larger brain-cavity and orbits, and
                    less-developed cranial ridges being due to its smaller size.</p>
